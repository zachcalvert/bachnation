Now, after retiring from baseball and opening up a gym for high school athletes, Mike is ready to focus on the missing piece in his life – finding love. Mike describes himself as easygoing, social, goofy and disciplined. He is looking for a woman who loves staying active, will make him laugh, and most importantly, has the same set of values as he does. Mike's family is extremely important to him so, ideally, he is looking to find someone whom his parents and three sisters absolutely adore. Mike loves his life and is 100% ready to share his life with the woman of his dreams. Is Katie that woman?
